        Marie Curie, born Maria Sk≈Çodowska, was a Polish physicist and chemist
        who made groundbreaking contributions to the field of radioactivity. She
        was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the only person to
        receive it in two different fields - physics and chemistry. Curie's
        interest in science began at a young age, and she pursued higher
        education in physics and mathematics at the University of Paris. While
        studying, she met her future husband, Pierre Curie, and together they
        conducted research on radioactive materials, discovering two new
        elements - polonium and radium. Their work on radioactivity led to the
        development of the field of nuclear physics and radiation therapy, which
        revolutionized the treatment of cancer. However, their work also exposed
        them to dangerous levels of radiation, and both Pierre and Marie
        suffered from radiation-related illnesses. After Pierre's death, Marie
        continued their research and became the first woman to teach at the
        University of Paris. She received numerous awards and honors for her
        contributions to science, including being the first woman to receive the
        Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, along with Pierre and another physicist,
        Henri Becquerel. In 1911, she received her second Nobel Prize, this time
        in Chemistry, for her discovery of radium and polonium. Despite facing
        discrimination and adversity as a woman in a male-dominated field, Curie
        continued to pursue her passion for science and inspire future
        generations of women in STEM. Today, her legacy lives on through the
        numerous scientific advancements and innovations that have stemmed from
        her work. Marie Curie's contributions to science have cemented her place
        as one of the most important and influential scientists of all time.

              individuals. To that end, each of us must work for his own
              improvement and, at the same time, share a general responsibility
              for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom
              we think we can be most useful."</em

              >"Unknown in Paris, I was lost in the great city, but the feeling
              of living there alone, taking care of myself without any aid, did
              not at all depress me. If sometimes I felt lonesome, my usual
              state of mind was one of calm and great moral satisfaction."</em
